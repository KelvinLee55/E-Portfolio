I worked as an intern at WWF in 2022 and at AFCD (the Hong Kong government agency for nature conservation and management) in 2024, respectively. I enjoyed introducing various historical buildings and species to participants when I interned as an event services assistant at WWF. Meanwhile, I was privileged to engage in the government-led internship program, helping to inspect tree conditions for NGOs, develop a seedling planting guide, and analyze data for Plantation Enrichment Programme (PEP) pilot sites.\nMy profound affinity with wildlife and plants has been built around my erstwhile career path, pushing me to contribute more to the earth that we all have relied on. During my leisure time, I am fond of camping and trekking, both of which are the best ways to feel nature and also connect with like-minded people. Apart from that, I am particularly intrigued by how urban green spaces mitigate air pollution. In some cases, vegetation would increase the amount of air pollutants in an urban setting.\nI aim to explore the factors driving these contrasting outcomes through the knowledge and insights gained from the MGEM Program. Regarding my research aspirations, I would like to concentrate on topics such as air quality as well as heat waves in our cities. I am eager to leverage my passion for nature and urban sustainability to advance innovative conservation solutions through the MGEM Program."

I worked with GeoTIFF orthophotos, LAS/LAZ LiDAR point clouds, and vector datasets (SHP, GeoJSON, KML), which supported field-based mapping and wildfire response planning.\n\nEcological Survey and Plantation Management Intern\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), Hong Kong | Jun 2024 – Aug 2024\n\nIn my role as an intern at AFCD, I contributed to tree condition inspections for NGOs, developed a seedling planting guide, and applied geospatial and data management tools, including ArcGIS Pro, to analyze data from Plantation Enrichment Programme (PEP) pilot sites.\n\nEnvironmental Education Intern\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Hong Kong | Jun 2022 – Aug 2022\n\nI completed an internship at WWF, during which I communicated topics related to coral reef and tiger conservation through public talks and ecotours, and developed educational materials and standard operating procedures (SOPs). These experiences strengthened my presentation skills, ability to work independently, and resilience in fast-paced settings.\n\nField Investigator\nFood Grace, Hong Kong | Oct 2021 – Jan 2022\n\nI was offered employment at Food Grace to interview restaurant managers about food-waste management practices. This includes, but is not limited to, qualitative data collection, environmental reporting, and stakeholder communication. These efforts were translated into the sustainability assessment in different Hong Kong districts.\n\n\nPublications\nMajor Projects:\n\nLee, K. H. (2025).

    "text": "This is a sample page where you can archive project deliverables. Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){\n  ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red)\n  return(ndvi)\n}\n(Assuming nir and red are terra rast objects)\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir - red)/(nir + red)\n  return(ndvi)\n(Assuming nir and red are numpy arrays)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a Google Earth Engine application I developed - which I embedded in this webpage using the code below:\n\n\n&lt;iframe width=\"900\" height=\"700\"\nsrc=\"https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool\"&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nThe full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
